# Student Grades Data Analysis 

This project analyses student grades data and predicts missing courses using a regression tree implemented in Java with JavaFX. It involves loading data from files, manipulating it into sets, computing statistics to look for patterns, and presenting insights through a simple user interface built with JavaFX. It also includes implementing a regression tree algorithm, generating Random Forest models for prediction, and visualizing regression trees for individual courses.
